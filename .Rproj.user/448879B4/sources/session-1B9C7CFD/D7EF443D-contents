Let's invoke the libraries we need in this exercise.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

Before analysis, let's take a look what we have in the dataset.

```{r}
glimpse(planes)
```
## The number of planes having Turbo-jet engine by manufacturer

```{r}
planes%>%
  filter(engine == "Turbo-jet")%>%
  group_by(manufacturer,model,engine)%>%
  summarize(count=n())%>%
  arrange(desc(count))

```

## The number of planes with age and manufacturer detail

```{r}
planes%>%
  group_by(manufacturer,model) %>%
  summarize(count=n(),avg_age = mean(2022-year, na.rm = T))%>%
  arrange(desc(count), avg_age)
  
```
