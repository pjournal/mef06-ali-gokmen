Let's invoke the libraries we need in this exercise.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(shiny)
```

Before creating dashboard, let's read and fix the datasets.

```{r}
students <- read_excel("Shiny/foreign_students.xlsx")
saveRDS(students, file = "students.rds")
readRDS(file = "students.rds")
```

```{r}
new_cols <- c("university","type","province","nationality","male","female","total")
colnames(students) <- new_cols

students <- na.omit(students)

students <- students %>% mutate(`female` = as.numeric(`female`))
students <- students %>% mutate(`male` = as.numeric(`male`))
students <- students %>% mutate(`total` = as.numeric(`total`))

students
```
